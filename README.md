# Jake Spurlock - As Your Employee

Samuel Beckett wrote in Westward Ho, _Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better._

I embrace failure because the only way to avoid failure is to do nothing, which means never trying, that leads into never succeeding. Failure is just another opportunity to learn and [stay humble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvTRZJ-4EyI).

## What You Can Expect From Me

- **Life/Work Balance** - Understanding that this a job. I will always give priorirty to family, and while there might be late nights, or work on the weekend, that shouldn't be the expectation.
- **Honesty** - I will be honest, but I might be guarded at the same time. When you are employee, you are at a power imbalance with a manager, and that needs to be understood.
- **Encouragement** - I want to see you as a manager grow and be fearless, and I want you empowering me as an employee.
- **Open Door, Open Mind, Open Heart** - You can come to me exactly as you are, not even as your best self. We are all trying to get through life the best way we know how, and none of us have a manual.

## What I Expect of Managers

- Know what you don’t know
- Be open, honest, direct
- Help your team, participate in code reviews
- Give me feedback - feedback is a gift
- Ask for help
- Encourage not discourage
- Embrace constructive feedback; ignore what isn't
- Take care of yourself
- Bring questions and concerns to 1:1 - write them down throughout the week
- Warn me early if a deadline is not reasonable, or if unexpected problems occur. I can only manage the things I know about.
- Treat everything as if you own it. This means raising concerns, fixing things, etc.

## I Value

- Empathy
- Initiative
- Humor and positivity
- Adaptability
- Efficiency
- Structure
- Accountability
- Being Open and Vulnerable

## What Puts Me on Edge

- **Vague Goals** - If there is a goal or deliverable, be explicit in what you want, and then everyone can be accountable for a deliverable.
- **Bike Shedding** - We aren't doing rocket surgery, let's build and ship cool things fast. Fix it in post.
- People whose **opinions drown out everyone else**, who don't agree to disagree, and make others feel marginalized
- When I'm **out of coffee**
- **Meetings that prioritize EST**. No, I don't want to take a meeting at 7am. For the same reason you don't want to take one at 8pm on a Friday.

**How will you know I’m on edge?**

[I might disappear into the weeds](https://media.giphy.com/media/4pMX5rJ4PYAEM/giphy.gif). Prolly a good time to reach out.

**How can you help me when I’m on edge?**

I often treat grumpiness with humor and sarcasm, indulge me! Empathy and kindness are good helps too. Tell me to take a walk and get some fresh air too is good for my mental stability.

## Remote Worker

Condé Nast is a huge company that has people in the ranks from all over the country. One thing that needs to be understood as we seek to become a truly global company is that not all people will be gathered around the same watercooler during the day. Conversations that are held in person, or in private channels where decisions are made need to be surfaced to all parties. If this means sending an email, or getting on a Zoom, make that happen.

Further, just because something is said in Slack, or in a commit message, that doesn't mean that it will be read/understood/executed. When in doubt, look for facetime with people. Zoom is fantastic, use it.
