# GeGe Pincin - As Your Manager

### _Sometimes you have to get it wrong, to get it right._

Thomas Edison once said, _I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work._

I embrace failure because the only way to avoid failure is to do nothing, which means never trying, that leads into never succeeding. Failure is just another opportunity to learn and stay humbled.

**Favorite Quote:**

“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid” ~ Unknown

**My Favorite Fortune Cookie Fortune:**

The mightiest oak in the forest was just a little nut that stood its ground

## What You Can Expect From Me

- **Honesty** - Never ask a question if you aren’t expecting an honest answer in a very raw form.
- **Transparency** - I don’t play games and I don’t hide things. You should never have to read between the lines of what I’m saying.
- **Encouragement** - I want to see you grow and be fearless
- **Open Door, Open mind, Open heart** - You can come to me exactly as you are, not even as your best self. We are all trying to get through life the best way we know how, and none of us have a manual

## What I Expect of You

- Know what you don’t know
- Be open, honest, direct
- Help your team, participate in code reviews
- Give me feedback - feedback is a gift
- Ask for help
- Encourage not discourage
- Embrace constructive feedback; ignore what isn't
- Take care of yourself
- Bring questions and concerns to 1:1 - write them down throughout the week
- Warn me early if a deadline is not reasonable, or if unexpected problems occur. I can only manage the things I know about.

- Empathy
- Initiative

- Adaptability
- Efficiency

## What Makes Me Crabby

- **Techsplaining** - Being presumptuous about what I don’t know. You can trust that I know what I don’t know and therefore will request an explanation
- **Lack of gratitude** - I live by the philosophy that if you expect nothing, you will be grateful for everything
- **Deflecting** not taking accountability
- **Shaming and blaming**
- People whose **opinions drown out everyone else**, who don't agree to disagree, and make others feel marginalized
- When I'm **out of coffee**

**How will you know I’m crabby?**

I’ll be direct about it, and/or avoid the trigger

**How can you help me when I’m crabby?**

I often treat grumpiness with humor and sarcasm, indulge me!
